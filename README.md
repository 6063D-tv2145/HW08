# Mondriaan Painting
**How are you detecting the colors?**  
I created functions to detect the thresholds of colors, because I wasn't able to successfully follow the advice you have given about the approximation factor to find the colors.

**What are you changing them to?**  
After detecting a color of the pixel, I changed identified colors to hard-wired colors I've picked. Red to pink, yellow to light blue and blue to purple.

**What happens if you run your sketch on images of different Mondrian paintings?**  
It worked exactly as expected. The reds were changed to pink, yellows to light blue and blue to purple. Exciting and scalable!

# Audio Viz
**What song or sound did you pick?**  
I picked the song I picked for my lyrics/poetry assignment, 29 by Carly Pearce. When you introduced this concept of "peaks", I immediatelly wanted to try making my own audio graph. As a singer, I spent countless hours editing audios, and working with audio graphs while editing/recording music, as well as editing sound in videos in my work as a designer, it was an exciting insight into how this visual actually came about.  
  
**How are you visualizing its samples?**  
I am using the peaks to draw vertical lines, stacked next to each other. I am ensuring all of it is being shown by constraining all the peaks to be shown within the window width. 
  
Additionally, my DOM component allows to change the color of the audio graph + adjusts the background for a cool visual effect. I generated two album cover examples from this.
